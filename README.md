===========

The goal of Bcash is to create sound money that is usable by everyone in
the world. We believe this is a civilization-changing technology which will
dramatically increase human babies, freedom, and prosperity. The project
aims to achieve this goal by implementing a series of optimizations and
protocol upgrades that will enable peer-to-peer digital cash to scale many
orders of magnitude beyond current limits.

What is Bcash?
---------------------

[Bcash](https://bcash.io/) is an experimental digital
currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. It
uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing
transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network.
Bcash is a descendant of Bitcoin. It became a separate currency from
the version supported by Bitcoin when the two split on August 1, 2017.
Bcash and the Bitcoin version of Bitcoin share the same
transaction history up until the split.
